This project provides a cleaned version of the [mtsamples medical transcription dataset](https://www.mtsamples.com/), containing real-world clinical transcription reports. It is intended for educational and machine learning purposes, such as medical NLP, specialty classification, symptom tagging, and more.

You can load and explore the cleaned dataset in a notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("mtsamples.csv")

# View structure
print(df.shape)
