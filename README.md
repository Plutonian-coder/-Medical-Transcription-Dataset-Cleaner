# ðŸ©º Medical Transcription Dataset Cleaner

This project provides a cleaned version of the [mtsamples medical transcription dataset](https://www.mtsamples.com/), containing real-world clinical transcription reports. It is intended for educational and machine learning purposes, such as medical NLP, specialty classification, symptom tagging, and more.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset Overview

- ðŸ“Š **Total Samples:** 4,999
- ðŸ§  **Columns:**

| Column Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `description`      | A short title summarizing the case |
| `medical_specialty`| The medical field involved (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology) |
| `sample_name`      | Unique label identifying the sample |
| `transcription`    | Full medical transcription (clinical report) |
| `keywords`         | Comma-separated keywords related to the case |

> Note: The dataset originally had an index column `Unnamed: 0` which has been removed in the cleaned version.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Performed

- âœ… Removed unnecessary index column (`Unnamed: 0`)
- âœ… Dropped or handled rows with null `transcription` or `keywords`
- âœ… Standardized case and spacing
- âœ… Ensured all records contain clean, usable data for NLP modeling

---

## ðŸ§ª Usage Example



You can load and explore the cleaned dataset in a notebook:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("mtsamples.csv")

# View structure
print(df.shape)
print(df.columns)

# View sample
df.head()
```



ðŸ“Š Example Records
